Sam and Lily walked through the forest, the trees rising tall around them. Sam carried a small backpack, his steps steady and sure. Lily held a sketchpad, her eyes darting to every flower and tree. 

“Wait, Sam!” she said, stopping to draw a wildflower. Sam sighed but waited. As a brother, he felt responsible. 

When she finished, they continued together, their path winding deeper into the woods. The air grew cooler, and the forest quieted. 

At a clearing, sunlight broke through the canopy. Sam smiled. “We’re close.”

Lily nodded, her sketchpad tucked away. They had found their way.
