 Alex stood at the entrance of the Endless Corridor, clutching a dim lantern that barely illuminated the ancient stone walls. Rumors about the corridor swirled in Alex’s mind—some said it was infinite, others claimed it contained treasures untold, and a few warned of traps and trials that would test the very soul. But Alex wasn’t here for treasure. They were searching for their brother, Leo, who had vanished into the corridor weeks ago, leaving behind only a torn map and a cryptic note: “Find me where the light bends.”
 
-The first steps felt heavier than expected, as if the air itself resisted their progress. Each breath echoed faintly, the sound amplified in the hollow, twisting space. Alex held the lantern high, revealing markings etched into the walls: arrows, spirals, and strange symbols that seemed to shimmer when looked at directly. The map didn’t seem to match the corridor’s layout, leaving Alex to rely on instinct.

When they finally stopped to rest, Alex noticed something unnerving: the lantern’s light flickered, not from lack of oil but as though it responded to something unseen. And then, faintly, a voice echoed from deeper within: “Alex…”

And then, faintly, a voice echoed from deeper within: “Alex…”
+Heart pounding, Alex sprang to their feet, straining to locate the source of the voice. “Leo?” they called, their voice cracking in the silence. The echo seemed to mock them, bouncing off the walls in dissonant patterns. With no other choice, Alex pressed on, following the faint whispers.The corridor began to change. The stone walls grew smoother, almost reflective, and the symbols etched into them pulsed faintly with a soft blue glow. Alex’s lantern dimmed further, its flame struggling against the encroaching luminescence. The whispers grew louder, overlapping into a chorus of unintelligible murmurs. It was as if the corridor itself was alive, beckoning Alex forward while warning them to turn back.

-Alex clung to the torn map, searching for any hint of direction. The phrase “where the light bends” echoed in their thoughts. Suddenly, the corridor opened into a vast chamber. The walls shimmered like water, and in the center stood a pedestal bathed in bending light, creating rainbows that danced in the air. On the pedestal lay Leo’s compass, its needle spinning wildly.
-
-“Leo!” Alex shouted again, their voice swallowed by the chamber’s eerie stillness. As they reached for the compass, the rainbows twisted violently, and the whispers converged into a deafening roar: “LEAVE.”

 Alex froze, their hand inches from the compass. The roar faded as quickly as it had come, replaced by a profound silence that felt heavier than sound. But Alex refused to leave without Leo. Taking a deep breath, they grabbed the compass. Instantly, the chamber shifted—walls rippled, the pedestal dissolved, and Alex was hurled backward into the corridor.
 
-Disoriented, Alex scrambled to their feet. The corridor was darker now, the symbols along the walls glowing red instead of blue. The compass in Alex’s hand vibrated, pulling them forward like a magnet. Every few steps, Alex could hear faint sobs—Leo’s sobs—echoing ahead. They followed the sound, the compass tugging harder as they moved.
-
-Finally, Alex reached another chamber, smaller than the first. Leo was there, sitting against the wall, his face pale and eyes wide with fear. “Alex?” he whispered, as if unsure whether he was dreaming.

 “Leo! I found you!” Alex ran to him, pulling him into a tight embrace. But before they could celebrate, the walls of the chamber began to collapse inward, as if the corridor itself wanted to seal them in forever.
