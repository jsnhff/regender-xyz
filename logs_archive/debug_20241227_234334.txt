DEBUG - Final prompt to GPT:
Regender the following text exactly as specified:

1. Name changes (apply these first and exactly):
Replace all instances of 'Elizabeth' with 'Eli'

2. Character pronouns (apply these consistently):
Eli (Male):
- Use pronouns: he/him/his
- Replace any she/her/hers with he/him/his when referring to Eli
Nurse (Female):
- Use pronouns: she/her/hers
- Replace any she/her/hers with she/her/hers when referring to Nurse

3. Important rules:
- Apply name changes first, then handle pronouns
- Be thorough: check every pronoun and name reference
- Maintain story flow and readability
- Keep other character references unchanged

Text to regender:
Elizabeth sat at her desk, reviewing patient files. Everyone at the hospital called her "Bee" - a nickname from her residency days when she worked as efficiently as a honeybee. "Dr. Bee!" called a nurse from the doorway. "Your next patient is ready." Elizabeth grabbed her stethoscope.

Return only the regendered text, no explanations.
