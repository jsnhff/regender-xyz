Sam and Lily walked through the forest, the trees rising tall around them. Sam carried a small backpack, his steps steady and sure. Lily held a sketchpad, her eyes darting to every flower and tree. 

Behind them, their cousin Jake trailed, whistling softly as he tossed a pebble from hand to hand. Nearby, their aunt Clara paused to adjust her sunhat, scanning the trail ahead with a protective eye. Grandpa Henry walked beside her, his sturdy walking stick thudding against the dirt path. 

“Almost there,” Clara called softly, glancing at her husband, Tom, who carried a basket filled with snacks. Together, they moved through the quiet woods, the group a mix of laughter and steady footsteps.

At a clearing, sunlight broke through the canopy. Sam smiled. “We’re close.”

Lily nodded, her sketchpad tucked away. Jake grinned, Grandpa Henry chuckled, and Clara sighed with relief. They had found their way.
