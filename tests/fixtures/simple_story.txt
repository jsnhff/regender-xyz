THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR

By Test Author

CHAPTER 1: The Arrival

Mr. James Wilson stood at the window of his study, watching the rain fall steadily against the glass. He had lived alone in the old manor house for nearly twenty years, and visitors were rare. The isolation suited him perfectly.

"Strange," he muttered to himself, "the postman mentioned someone asking about the manor in the village."

CHAPTER 2: The Meeting

The next morning, James heard a knock at the door. He opened it to find a young woman standing on his doorstep. She wore a dark traveling cloak and carried a worn leather satchel.

"Mr. Wilson?" she asked. "My name is Sarah Chen. I believe you knew my grandmother, Mary Chen. She worked here many years ago."

James studied her face carefully. There was something familiar about her eyes. "Mary Chen," he repeated slowly. "Yes, I remember her. She was the housekeeper here when I was just a boy."
