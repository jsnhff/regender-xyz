## Key Changes Reflected

1. **Main CLI Change**: All documentation now correctly shows `regender_book_cli.py` as the primary interface
2. **MLX Support**: Added throughout as a first-class provider option
3. **Directory Structure**: Updated to show the unified `books/` directory with subdirectories
4. **Paragraph Structure**: Documentation now shows how to handle the new paragraph-aware JSON format
5. **Removed Features**: Documentation no longer references removed CLI files or old workflows

## Backward Compatibility Notes

The documentation maintains references to backward compatibility for:
- Old JSON structure (flat sentences) vs new (paragraphs)
- Both are supported in the transformation system

## Usage Patterns

The documentation now consistently shows these usage patterns:
```bash
# Process books
python regender_book_cli.py process

# Transform with MLX (local, no API costs)
python regender_book_cli.py transform books/json/book.json --provider mlx

# Transform with OpenAI
python regender_book_cli.py transform books/json/book.json --provider openai --model gpt-4o

# Batch transform
python regender_book_cli.py transform books/json/*.json --type comprehensive --batch
```

## Next Steps

Users reading the updated documentation will:
1. Understand that `regender_book_cli.py` is the main interface
2. Know how to use MLX for local, private transformations
3. Understand the new paragraph-aware JSON structure
4. Be able to choose between providers based on their needs
