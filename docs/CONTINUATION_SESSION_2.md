# Regender-XYZ Continuation - Session 2
## Date: September 21, 2025

## Previous Session Summary
Fixed critical character extraction issues that were missing main protagonists (especially female characters like Elizabeth Bennet). System now successfully identifies all major and minor characters.

## What We Fixed This Session

### 1. ✅ Character Extraction - MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS
**Before:** Only found 19 characters in Pride & Prejudice, missed ALL Bennet sisters
**After:** Found 49 characters including all 8 Bennet family members

#### Key Fixes Applied:
1. **Fixed Tokenization**
   - Was: `len(word) / 4` (wildly inaccurate)
   - Now: `chunk_size * 1.3` (proper GPT token approximation)
   - Result: 17 properly-sized chunks vs 5-6 oversized chunks

2. **Enhanced Extraction Prompts**
   ```python
   # Added explicit instructions to find protagonists
   IMPORTANT: Extract ALL characters mentioned in the text, ESPECIALLY:
   - The PROTAGONIST(S) and main point-of-view characters
   - Main characters who drive the plot
   - All family members of main characters (sisters, brothers, parents, etc.)
   ```

3. **Fixed Over-Aggressive Grouping**
   - Added family member detection to prevent merging "Elizabeth Bennet" with "Jane Bennet"
   - Increased similarity threshold from 0.7 to 0.8
   - Result: 295 raw mentions → 49 final characters (was 107 → 19)

4. **Performance Settings**
   - Batch size: 25 paragraphs for transformation
   - Chunk size: 32000 tokens for character extraction
   - Character chunk size: 41,600 chars (32000 * 1.3)

### 2. ⚠️ Issues Discovered

1. **60-Second Mystery Delay**
   - Character extraction has unexplained 60-second delay before first API call
   - Needs investigation in async processing code

2. **Slow Sequential Processing**
   - Processing chunks one at a time (should be parallel)
   - Takes ~14 minutes for Pride & Prejudice character extraction

3. **Bad Metadata**
   - Pride & Prejudice shows title as "George Allen" (publisher name)
   - Author field contains gibberish
   - Parser needs fixing for proper metadata extraction

## Test Results

### A Modest Proposal (Small Book)
- Characters: 13 found
- Time: 17 seconds
- Status: ✅ Working well

### Pride & Prejudice (Large Book)
- Characters: 49 found (including all Bennets!)
- Raw mentions: 295
- Time: ~14.5 minutes
- Status: ✅ Working but slow

### Character Breakdown for Pride & Prejudice:
```
✅ Elizabeth Bennet (protagonist!)
✅ Jane Bennet
✅ Mary Bennet
✅ Catherine/Kitty Bennet
✅ Lydia Bennet
✅ Mr. Bennet
✅ Mrs. Bennet
✅ Mr. Darcy
✅ Mr. Bingley
... and 40 more characters
```

## Current File Structure
```
books/output/{book-name}-{timestamp}/
├── characters.json       # Character analysis (saved immediately)
├── gender_swap.json     # Transformed book (saved after transformation)
└── gender_swap.txt      # ASCII print-ready text (saved last)
```

## Next Session Priorities

### High Priority Fixes
1. **Fix 60-second delay** - Debug async initialization in character_service.py
2. **Enable parallel chunk processing** - Currently sequential, should be concurrent
3. **Fix metadata parsing** - Books showing wrong title/author
4. **Add progress indicators** - Show % complete during long operations

### Medium Priority
1. **Add character validation** - Ensure known books have expected characters
2. **Implement caching** - Cache character analysis for re-runs
3. **Add streaming output** - Write paragraphs as they complete
4. **Resume capability** - Continue from interruption point

### Performance Targets
- Character extraction: < 5 minutes for full novels
- Transformation: < 30 minutes for full novels
- Eliminate the 60-second startup delay

## Code Locations

### Key Files Modified
- `/src/services/character_service.py` - Fixed chunking and grouping
- `/src/services/prompts.py` - Enhanced character extraction prompt
- `/src/config.json` - Optimized batch/chunk sizes
- `/src/app.py` - Added incremental file saving

### Problem Areas to Investigate
- Line 167-215 in `character_service.py` - Async processing with 60s delay
- `_extract_all_characters` method - Should process chunks in parallel
- Parser service - Metadata extraction is broken

## Commands for Testing

```bash
# Quick test with small book
source .env
export DEFAULT_PROVIDER='openai'
export OPENAI_MODEL='gpt-4o-mini'
python regender_cli.py books/json/pg1080-A_Modest_Proposal.json character_analysis --no-qc

# Full test with Pride & Prejudice
python regender_cli.py books/json/pg1342-Pride_and_Prejudice.json character_analysis --no-qc

# End-to-end transformation
python regender_cli.py books/json/pg43-The_Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde.json gender_swap --no-qc
```

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Found all Bennet family members in Pride & Prejudice
- ✅ Increased character count from 19 to 49
- ✅ Fixed tokenization calculation
- ✅ Reduced over-aggressive merging
- ⚠️ Still has performance issues to address

## Notes for Next Session
The character extraction is now functionally correct but needs performance optimization. The 60-second delay and sequential processing are the main bottlenecks. The system should be able to process Pride & Prejudice in under 5 minutes once these issues are fixed.

Remember to check if background processes are still running when resuming!
