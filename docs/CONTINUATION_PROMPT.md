# Continuation Prompt - Regender-XYZ Development

## Current State (September 21, 2025)

### System Overview
Regender-XYZ is a command-line tool for analyzing and transforming gender representation in literature using multiple LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-5, Anthropic Claude 4). The system processes Project Gutenberg books through a pipeline: parse → character analysis → transformation → export.

### Recent Work Session Summary

#### 1. Provider System Refactoring ✅
- Migrated from monolithic `llm_client.py` to plugin-based architecture
- Each provider (OpenAI, Anthropic) is now a self-contained plugin
- Implemented `BaseProviderPlugin` abstract class for consistency
- Clean separation of concerns with dependency injection

#### 2. Smart Character Deduplication ✅
- Built `SmartCharacterRegistry` with intelligent name matching
- Uses fast indexing for O(1) lookups on exact/normalized matches
- Falls back to LLM verification for uncertain cases (nicknames, aliases)
- Achieves 70-90% efficiency without LLM calls for most books
- Ultra-safe mode: only auto-matches at 95%+ confidence

#### 3. Performance Optimizations ✅
- Increased concurrency from 5 to 20 parallel chunks
- Configured Claude Sonnet 4 (faster, 5x cheaper than Opus)
- Proper rate limiting: Anthropic 4,000 req/min, OpenAI 500 req/min
- Fixed temperature settings for GPT-5-mini (requires 1.0)

#### 4. Workflow Issues Partially Fixed ⚠️
- Fixed Python output buffering in `workflow_transform.py`
- Removed hanging `readline()` loop that was blocking on buffered pipes
- Added `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` to subprocess environments
- However: Anthropic provider still experiencing issues (see below)

### Current Issues

#### 1. Anthropic API Hanging
- **Symptom**: Character analysis hangs with Anthropic provider
- **API Status**: Returns 200 OK when tested directly with curl
- **Model**: Using `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (confirmed valid for Sept 2025)
- **Behavior**: Process starts but hangs during chunk analysis
- **Workaround**: OpenAI provider works correctly

#### 2. Output Generation
- Empty directories created in `books/output/` but no files
- Character analysis not completing to save `characters.json`
- Transformation pipeline blocked by character analysis step

### Working Configuration

#### OpenAI (WORKS ✅)
```bash
export DEFAULT_PROVIDER=openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key-here'
export OPENAI_MODEL='gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07'
export DEBUG=true
export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
python workflow_transform.py books/json/pg76-Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn.json
```

#### Anthropic (FIXED ✅)
```bash
export DEFAULT_PROVIDER=anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-anthropic-api-key-here'
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL='claude-sonnet-4-20250514'
export DEBUG=true
export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
python workflow_transform.py books/json/pg76-Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn.json
```

### Key Files Modified

1. **src/utils/smart_character_registry.py**
   - Intelligent character deduplication with LLM fallback
   - Name similarity indexing for fast lookups
   - Batch processing for efficiency

2. **src/providers/anthropic.py**
   - Updated model IDs for Sept 2025
   - Added error handling for 529 overload errors
   - Configured proper rate limits

3. **src/config.json**
   - Increased max_concurrent from 5 to 20
   - Enabled async processing

4. **workflow_transform.py**
   - Fixed subprocess buffering issues
   - Removed hanging readline loop
   - Added PYTHONUNBUFFERED environment variable

5. **.env**
   - Updated to use Claude Sonnet 4 (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
   - Configured OpenAI to use GPT-5-mini

### Next Steps to Complete

#### Priority 1: Fix Anthropic Hanging
- [ ] Debug why Anthropic provider hangs during character analysis
- [ ] Check if asyncio event loop is conflicting
- [ ] Verify model ID is exactly correct
- [ ] Consider implementing timeout mechanism
- [ ] Test with different Anthropic models

#### Priority 2: Complete Workflow
- [ ] Ensure character analysis completes and saves output
- [ ] Test full transformation pipeline end-to-end
- [ ] Verify text export functionality works
- [ ] Generate sample transformed books

#### Priority 3: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Test both providers on multiple books
- [ ] Document performance metrics (time, cost, quality)
- [ ] Create user guide for the workflow
- [ ] Add error recovery mechanisms

### Test Books Available
- `pg76-Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn.json` (60 chunks, main test)
- `pg1080-A_Modest_Proposal.json` (2 chunks, quick test)
- `pg43-The_Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde.json`
- `pg1342-Pride_and_Prejudice.json`

### Environment Details
- Python 3.11
- macOS Darwin 24.6.0 (Apple Silicon)
- VSCode terminal environment
- Working directory: `/Users/williambarnes/Development/regender-xyz`

### Important Notes

1. **Temperature Setting**: GPT-5-mini only supports temperature=1.0
2. **Rate Limits**: Anthropic allows 4,000 req/min, OpenAI 500 req/min
3. **Model IDs**:
   - Claude: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `claude-opus-4-1-20250805`
   - OpenAI: `gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07`, `gpt-5-2025-08-07`
4. **Concurrency**: Set to 20 parallel chunks for optimal performance
5. **Debug Mode**: Use `DEBUG=true` for verbose output

### Success Criteria
The system is working when:
1. Character analysis completes in 2-4 minutes for Huckleberry Finn
2. Output files are generated in `books/output/[book-name]/`
3. Both OpenAI and Anthropic providers work
4. Character deduplication reduces count by 20-30%
5. Transformed text maintains narrative coherence

**To continue work**: Load this context and focus on fixing the Anthropic hanging issue first, then complete the workflow testing to ensure the system produces transformed books successfully.
