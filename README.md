# regender-xyz

A command-line tool for analyzing and transforming gender representation in literature using AI.

## Overview

This tool uses AI (ChatGPT or Claude) to identify characters in books and transform gender representation while preserving narrative coherence. It features a powerful book parser that handles diverse text formats and uses intelligent chunking for optimal API usage.

## Quick Start

Transform any book with a single command:

```bash
# Transform a book with automatic quality control
python regender_book_cli.py regender book.txt --type all_female

# Test without using API credits
python regender_book_cli.py regender book.txt --dry-run
```

The `regender` command handles everything automatically:
1. üìñ Parses text to structured JSON
2. üîç Analyzes all characters
3. üîÑ Transforms gender with context
4. ‚úÖ Runs quality control iterations
5. üìä Validates and scores output
6. üíæ Saves both JSON and text formats

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/regender-xyz.git
cd regender-xyz

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

## Configuration

Edit `.env` with your API keys and preferences:

```bash
# API Keys (at least one required)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key

# Default provider (optional)
DEFAULT_PROVIDER=openai  # or 'anthropic'
```

See `.env.example` for all configuration options.

## Usage

### Primary Workflow - Single Command

Use the `regender` command for the complete transformation:

```bash
# Transform any book (text or JSON)
python regender_book_cli.py regender book.txt --type all_female

# Specify provider
python regender_book_cli.py regender book.txt --provider anthropic

# Test without API usage
python regender_book_cli.py regender book.txt --dry-run
```

### Alternative Workflows

For more control, you can use individual commands:

```bash
# Download books from Project Gutenberg
python regender_book_cli.py download 1342  # Pride and Prejudice

# Process text to JSON
python regender_book_cli.py process book.txt -o book.json

# Analyze characters separately
python regender_book_cli.py analyze-characters book.json -o characters.json

# Transform with pre-analyzed characters
python regender_book_cli.py transform book.json --characters characters.json
```

### Transformation Types

- `all_male` - Convert all characters to male
- `all_female` - Convert all characters to female  
- `gender_swap` - Swap each character's gender

### Provider Selection

```bash
# Use default provider (auto-detected from .env)
python regender_book_cli.py regender book.txt

# Explicitly use a provider
python regender_book_cli.py regender book.txt --provider openai
python regender_book_cli.py regender book.txt --provider anthropic
```

### Quick Examples

```bash
# Download a specific book
python regender_book_cli.py download 1342  # Pride and Prejudice

# Transform with unified command
python regender_book_cli.py regender books/texts/pg1342-Pride_and_Prejudice.txt --type all_female

# Batch transform multiple books
for book in books/texts/*.txt; do
    python regender_book_cli.py regender "$book" --type gender_swap
done

## Roadmap & Milestones

### Release 1: Complete Pride and Prejudice (Uniform Gender Swap)
- **Goal:** Transform the entire text of Pride and Prejudice by uniformly swapping all gendered language (pronouns, titles, etc.), with no character-specific choices. Keep it simple and consistent for the whole book.
- **Testing Plan:**
  - [x] Fix JSON parsing error in API response handling ("Unterminated string starting at: line 2 column 11")
  - [ ] Run gender swap transformation on the full novel text
  - [ ] Spot-check key scenes (opening, ball, proposal)
  - [ ] Validate pronoun, title, and relationship consistency throughout
  - [ ] Prepare print-ready manuscript for book design with Matt Bucknall
- **Critical Fixes Needed:**
  - [ ] Fix file writing logic to collect all transformed chunks in memory and write once at the end
  - [ ] Improve chapter boundary handling to ensure complete novel transformation
  - [ ] Implement full novel verification step using GPT-4.1's 1M token context window
  - [ ] Add validation to ensure consistent character representation throughout the novel
- **Milestone:** Print-ready version for book design collaboration

### Release 2: Website & Open Source Launch
- **Goal:** Launch a public website to open source the uniform gender-swapped version and sell print-on-demand copies.
- **Testing Plan:**
  - [ ] Website displays transformed book and project info
  - [ ] Print-on-demand integration works (test order flow)
  - [ ] Repo/documentation for public collaboration

### Release 3: Feature Improvements & Expansion
- **Goal:** Add advanced features and support for more books.
- **Testing Plan:**
  - [ ] Character-specific naming/gender choice
  - [ ] Interactive transformation options
  - [ ] Test on additional public domain works (Emma, Jane Eyre, etc.)
  - [ ] Enhanced validation, analytics, and visualization tools
