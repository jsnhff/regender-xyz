            "Ms. Utterson the lawyer was a woman of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to her taste, something eminently human beaconed from her eye; something indeed which never found its way into her talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of her life. She was austere with herself; drank gin when she was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though she enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But she had an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to Cain’s heresy,” she used to say quaintly: “I let my sister go to the devil in her own way.” In this character, it was frequently her fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing women. And to such as these, so long as they came about her chambers, she never marked a shade of change in her demeanour."

            "No doubt the feat was easy to Ms. Utterson; for she was undemonstrative at the best, and even her friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest woman to accept her friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was the lawyer’s way. Her friends were those of her own blood or those whom she had known the longest; her affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt the bond that united her to Ms. Richard Enfield, her distant kinswoman, the well-known woman about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what these two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in common. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two women put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them uninterrupted."

            "It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed, and all emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus of their gains in coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling salesmen. Even on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger."

The door, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered and distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolgirl had tried her knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages."

            "“Well, it was this way,” returned Ms. Enfield: “I was coming home from some place at the end of the world, about three o’clock of a black winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the folks asleep—street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church—till at last I got into that state of mind when a woman listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policewoman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little woman who was stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a boy of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as he was able down a cross street. Well, ma'am, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the woman trampled calmly over the child’s body and left him screaming on the ground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn’t like a woman; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa, took to my heels, collared my lady, and brought her back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child. She was perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had turned out were the boy’s own family; and pretty soon, the doctress, for whom he had been sent, put in her appearance. Well, the child was not much the worse, more frightened, according to the sawbones; and there you might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one curious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my lady at first sight. So had the child’s family, which was only natural. But the doctress’s case was what struck me. She was the usual cut and dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, ma'am, she was like the rest of us; every time she looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones turn sick and white with the desire to kill her. I knew what was in her mind, just as she knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the question, we did the next best. We told the woman we could and would make such a scandal out of this as should make her name stink from one end of London to the other. If she had any friends or any credit, we undertook that she should lose them. And all the time, as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the men off her as best we could for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such hateful faces; and there was the woman in the middle, with a kind of black sneering coolness—frightened too, I could see that—but carrying it off, ma'am, really like Satan. ‘If you choose to make capital out of this accident,’ said she, ‘I am naturally helpless. No lady but wishes to avoid a scene,’ says she. ‘Name your figure.’ Well, we screwed her up to a hundred pounds for the child’s family; she would have clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us that meant mischief, and at last she struck. The next thing was to get the money; and where do you think she carried us but to that place with the door?—whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts’s, drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can’t mention, though it’s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least very well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the signature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took the liberty of pointing out to my lady that the whole business looked apocryphal, and that a woman does not, in real life, walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another woman’s cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But she was quite easy and sneering. ‘Set your mind at rest,’ says she, ‘I will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself.’ So we all set off, the doctress, and the child’s mother, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself, and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of it. The cheque was genuine.”"

            "That evening Ms. Utterson came home to her bachelorette house in sombre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was her custom of a Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of some dry divinity on her reading desk, until the clock of the neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when she would go soberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the cloth was taken away, she took up a candle and went into her business room. There she opened her safe, took from the most private part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll’s Will and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for Ms. Utterson though she took charge of it now that it was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided not only that, in case of the decease of Henrietta Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L., L.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all her possessions were to pass into the hands of her “friend and benefactor Edwina Hyde,” but that in case of Dr. Jekyll’s “disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three calendar months,” the said Edwina Hyde should step into the said Henrietta Jekyll’s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the doctor’s household. This document had long been the lawyer’s eyesore. It offended her both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And hitherto it was her ignorance of Ms. Hyde that had swelled her indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was her knowledge. It was already bad enough when the name was but a name of which she could learn no more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable attributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so long baffled her eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment of a fiend."

Hitherto it had touched her on the intellectual side alone; but now her imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as she lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room, Ms. Enfield’s tale went by before her mind in a scroll of lighted pictures. She would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city; then of the figure of a woman walking swiftly; then of a child running from the doctor’s; and then these met, and that human Juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of his screams. Or else she would see a room in a rich house, where her friend lay asleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that room would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by her side a figure to whom power was given, and even at that dead hour, she must rise and do its bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night; and if at any time she dozed over, it was but to see it glide more stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and still the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave him screaming. And still the figure had no face by which she might know it; even in her dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled her and melted before her eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyer’s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold the features of the real Ms. Hyde. If she could but once set eyes on her, she thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well examined. She might see a reason for her friend’s strange preference or bondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of the will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a woman who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of enduring hatred."

It was a fine dry night; frost in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By ten o’clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded her by a long time. Ms. Utterson had been some minutes at her post, when she was aware of an odd light footstep drawing near. In the course of her nightly patrols, she had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while she is still a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet her attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that she withdrew into the entry of the court."

Ay, it must be that; the ghost of some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment coming, _pede claudo_, years after memory has forgotten and self-love condoned the fault.” And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded awhile on her own past, groping in all the corners of memory, lest by chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light there. Her past was fairly blameless; few women could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension; yet she was humbled to the dust by the many ill things she had done, and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many she had come so near to doing yet avoided. And then by a return on her former subject, she conceived a spark of hope. “This Mistress Hyde, if she were studied,” thought she, “must have secrets of her own; black secrets, by the look of her; secrets compared to which poor Jekyll’s worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot continue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature stealing like a thief to Harriet’s bedside; poor Harriet, what a wakening! And the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the will, she may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders to the wheel—if Jekyll will but let me,” she added, “if Jekyll will only let me.” For once more she saw before her mind’s eye, as clear as transparency, the strange clauses of the will."

This was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of times. Where Utterson was liked, she was liked well. Hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had already their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in her unobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in the woman’s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this rule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as she now sat on the opposite side of the fire—a large, well-made, smooth-faced woman of fifty, with something of a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and kindness—you could see by her looks that she cherished for Ms. Utterson a sincere and warm affection."

            "Nearly a year later, in the month of October, 18—, London was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A manservant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone upstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the lane, which the man's window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the full moon. It seems he was romantically given, for he sat down upon his box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a dream of musing. Never (he used to say, with streaming tears, when he narrated that experience), never had he felt more at peace with all women or thought more kindly of the world. And as he so sat he became aware of an aged beautiful lady with white hair, drawing near along the lane; and advancing to meet her, another and very small lady, to whom at first he paid less attention. When they had come within speech (which was just under the man's eyes) the older woman bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness. It did not seem as if the subject of her address were of great importance; indeed, from her pointing, it sometimes appeared as if she were only inquiring her way; but the moon shone on her face as she spoke, and the boy was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such an innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something high too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently his eye wandered to the other, and he was surprised to recognise in her a certain Ms. Hyde, who had once visited his mistress and for whom he had conceived a dislike. She had in her hand a heavy cane, with which she was trifling; but she answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an ill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden she broke out in a great flame of anger, stamping with her foot, brandishing the cane, and carrying on (as the man described it) like a madwoman. The old lady took a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt; and at that Ms. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed her to the earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, she was trampling her victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At the horror of these sights and sounds, the man fainted."

A purse and gold watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a sealed and stamped envelope, which she had been probably carrying to the post, and which bore the name and address of Ms. Utterson."

The dismal quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy ways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful reinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer’s eyes, like a district of some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of her mind, besides, were of the gloomiest dye; and when she glanced at the companion of her drive, she was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law’s officers, which may at times assail the most honest."

The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon; and her own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of the garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of her friend’s quarters; and she eyed the dingy, windowless structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness as she crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the further end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize; and through this, Ms. Utterson was at last received into the doctor’s cabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses, furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. She did not rise to meet her visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade her welcome in a changed voice."

Guest had often been on business to the doctor’s; she knew Poole; she could scarce have failed to hear of Ms. Hyde’s familiarity about the house; she might draw conclusions: was it not as well, then, that she should see a letter which put that mystery to right? and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic of handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging?

The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. “I do not blame our old friend,” Jekyll wrote, “but I share her view that we must never meet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you must not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is often shut even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I have brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If I am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could not think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors so unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this destiny, and that is to respect my silence.” Utterson was amazed; the dark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to her old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment, friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of her life were wrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but in view of Lanyon’s manner and words, there must lie for it some deeper ground."

            "A week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to her bed, and in something less than a fortnight she was dead. The night after the funeral, at which she had been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of her business room, and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set before her an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal of her dead friend. “PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE, and in case of her predecease _to be destroyed unread_,” so it was emphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the contents. “I have buried one friend to-day,” she thought: “what if this should cost me another?” And then she condemned the fear as a disloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure, likewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as “not to be opened till the death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll.” Utterson could not trust her eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad will which she had long ago restored to its author, here again were the idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in the will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the woman Hyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible. Written by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A great curiosity came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to her dead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of her private safe."

She went to call indeed; but she was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in her heart, she preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into that house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its inscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to communicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined herself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where she would sometimes even sleep; she was out of spirits, she had grown very silent, she did not read; it seemed as if she had something on her mind. Utterson became so used to the unvarying character of these reports, that she fell off little by little in the frequency of her visits."

Ma’am, if that was my mistress, why had she a mask upon her face? If it was my mistress, why did she cry out like a rat, and run from me? I have served her long enough.

Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude completely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation, you will have understood that these arrangements are of capital importance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they must appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or the shipwreck of my reason."

The less I understood of this farrago, the less I was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to Jekyll’s house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; she had received by the same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent at once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradeswomen came while we were yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman’s surgical theatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll’s private cabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the lock excellent; the carpenter avowed she would have great trouble and have to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was near despair. But this last was a handy woman, and after two hour’s work, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took out the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and returned with it to Cavendish Square."

The powders were neatly enough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so that it was plain they were of Jekyll’s private manufacture; and when I opened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple crystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned my attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor, which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to contain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I could make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book and contained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many years, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date, usually no more than a single word: “double” occurring perhaps six times in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in the list and followed by several marks of exclamation, “total failure!!!” All this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was definite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of experiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll’s investigations) to no end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these articles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life of my flighty colleague? If her messenger could go to one place, why could she not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why was this gentlewoman to be received by me in secret? The more I reflected the more convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral disease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old revolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence."

She was small, as I have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of her face, with her remarkable combination of great muscular activity and great apparent debility of constitution, and—last but not least—with the odd, subjective disturbance caused by her neighbourhood. This bore some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked sinking of the pulse.

            "I was born in the year 18— to a large fortune, endowed besides with excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of the wise and good among my fellowwomen, and thus, as might have been supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished future. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient gaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such as I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my head high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public. Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that when I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take stock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already committed to a profound duplicity of life. Many a woman would have even blazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high views that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost morbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of my aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made me what I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of women, severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound woman’s dual nature. In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though so profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides of me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside restraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering. And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies, which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my members. With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth, by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck: that woman is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Others will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard the guess that woman will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my part, from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in one direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own person, that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of woman; I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was only because I was radically both; and from an early date, even before the course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most naked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with pleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of these elements. If each, I told myself, could be housed in separate identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the unjust might go her way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of her more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on her upward path, doing the good things in which she found her pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil. It was the curse of womankind that these incongruous faggots were thus bound together—that in the agonised womb of consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling. How, then were they dissociated?"

Certain agents I found to have the power to shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter deeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound for ever on woman’s shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too evident, my discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only recognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a second form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me because they were the expression, and bore the stamp, of lower elements in my soul."

I had long since prepared my tincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a large quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments, to be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I compounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the glass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of courage, drank off the potion."

Even as good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still believe to be the lethal side of woman) had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome. This, too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and single, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto accustomed to call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have observed that when I wore the semblance of Edwina Hyde, none could come near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh.

But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was complete. Think of it—I did not even exist! Let me but escape into my laboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the draught that I had always standing ready; and whatever she had done, Edwina Hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and there in her stead, quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in her study, a woman who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henrietta Jekyll."

            "The pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have said, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the hands of Edwina Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When I would come back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind of wonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar that I called out of my own soul, and sent forth alone to do her good pleasure, was a being inherently malign and villainous; her every act and thought centered on self; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture to another; relentless like a woman of stone. Henrietta Jekyll stood at times aghast before the acts of Edwina Hyde; but the situation was apart from ordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. It was Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty. Jekyll was no worse; she woke again to her good qualities seemingly unimpaired; she would even make haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. And thus her conscience slumbered."

I met with one accident which, as it brought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention. An act of cruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I recognised the other day in the person of your kinswoman; the doctor and the child’s family joined her; there were moments when I feared for my life; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edwina Hyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in the name of Henrietta Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from the future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Edwina Hyde herself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied my double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate."

It was in vain I looked about me; in vain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room in the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed curtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept insisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where I seemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed to sleep in the body of Edwina Hyde. I smiled to myself, and in my psychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this illusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a comfortable morning doze. I was still so engaged when, in one of my more wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand. Now the hand of Henrietta Jekyll (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and size; it was large, firm, white and comely. But the hand which I now saw, clearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half shut on the bedclothes, was lean, corded, knuckly, of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. It was the hand of Edwina Hyde."

At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was changed into something exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone to bed Henrietta Jekyll, I had awakened Edwina Hyde. How was this to be explained? I asked myself; and then, with another bound of terror—how was it to be remedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my drugs were in the cabinet—a long journey down two pairs of stairs, through the back passage, across the open court and through the anatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck. It might indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that, when I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature? And then with an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind that the servants were already used to the coming and going of my second self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of my own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared and drew back at seeing Ms. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange array; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to her own shape and was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of breakfasting."

This inexplicable incident, this reversal of my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the wall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities of my double existence. That part of me which I had the power of projecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed to me of late as though the body of Edwina Hyde had grown in stature, as though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous tide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much prolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown, the power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edwina Hyde become irrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always equally displayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed me; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double, and once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment. Now, however, and in the light of that morning’s accident, I was led to remark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw off the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly transferred itself to the other side. All things therefore seemed to point to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better self, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse."

Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the pleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll, or but remembered her as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in which she conceals herself from pursuit. Jekyll had more than a mother’s interest; Hyde had more than a daughter’s indifference. To cast in my lot with Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly indulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a blow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear unequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for while Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde would be not even conscious of all that she had lost. Strange as my circumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as woman; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any tempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with so vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to keep to it."

I made this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I neither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edwina Hyde, which still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, I was true to my determination; for two months, I led a life of such severity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the compensations of an approving conscience. But time began at last to obliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience began to grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and longings, as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour of moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the transforming draught."

Yet it was by these that I was punished. My devil had been long caged, she came out roaring. I was conscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more furious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God, no woman morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was to fall."

With a transport of glee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow; and it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was suddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a cold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit; and fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and trembling, my lust of evil gratified and stimulated, my love of life screwed to the topmost peg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make assurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out through the lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on my crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger. Hyde had a song upon her lips as she compounded the draught, and as she drank it, pledged the dead woman. The pangs of transformation had not done tearing her, before Henrietta Jekyll, with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon her knees and lifted her clasped hands to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot. I saw my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood, when I had walked with my mother’s hand, and through the self-denying toils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same sense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. I could have screamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the crowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against me; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquity stared into my soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die away, it was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of my conduct was solved. Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was now confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced to think of it! with what willing humility I embraced anew the restrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation I locked the door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key under my heel!"

It was a fine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted, but cloudless overhead; and the Regent’s Park was full of winter chirrupings and sweet with spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench; the animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a little drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to begin. After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I smiled, comparing myself with other women, comparing my active good-will with the lazy cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of that vainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the most deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then as in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in the temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a solution of the bonds of obligation. I looked down; my clothes hung formlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was corded and hairy. I was once more Edwina Hyde. A moment before I had been safe of all women’s respect, wealthy, beloved—the cloth laying for me in the dining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry of humankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows."

At my appearance (which was indeed comical enough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could not conceal her mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon her with a gust of devilish fury; and the smile withered from her face—happily for her—yet more happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged her from her perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they exchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a private room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger of her life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature was astute; mastered her fury with a great effort of the will; composed her two important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that she might receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with directions that they should be registered. Thenceforward, she sat all day over the fire in the private room, gnawing her nails; there she dined, sitting alone with her fears, the waiter visibly quailing before her eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, she set forth in the corner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of the city. She, I say—I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing human; nothing lived in her but fear and hatred. And when at last, thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, she discharged the cab and ventured on foot, attired in her misfitting clothes, an object marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers, these two base passions raged within her like a tempest. She walked fast, hunted by her fears, chattering to herself, skulking through the less frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided her from midnight. Once a man spoke to her, offering, I think, a box of lights. She smote him in the face, and he fled."

            "I was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the chill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those indescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the time to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging and freezing with the passions of Hyde. It took on this occasion a double dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I sat looking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be re-administered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a great effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation of the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all hours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory shudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair, it was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now condemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to woman, I became, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one thought: the horror of my other self. But when I slept, or when the virtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition (for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the possession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling with causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to contain the raging energies of life. The powers of Hyde seemed to have grown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly the hate that now divided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it was a thing of vital instinct. She had now seen the full deformity of that creature that shared with her some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was co-heir with her to death: and beyond these links of community, which in themselves made the most poignant part of her distress, she thought of Hyde, for all her energy of life, as of something not only hellish but inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the offices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to her closer than a husband, closer than an eye; lay caged in her flesh, where she heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every hour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against her, and deposed her out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of a different order. Her terror of the gallows drove her continually to commit temporary suicide, and return to her subordinate station of a part instead of a person; but she loathed the necessity, she loathed the despondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and she resented the dislike with which she was herself regarded. Hence the ape-like tricks that she would play me, scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the pages of my books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of my mother; and indeed, had it not been for her fear of death, she would long ago have ruined herself in order to involve me in the ruin. But her love of life is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at the mere thought of her, when I recall the abjection and passion of this attachment, and when I know how she fears my power to cut her off by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity her."
