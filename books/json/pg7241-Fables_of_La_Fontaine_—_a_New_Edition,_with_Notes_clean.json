'O citizens,' he sang, 'of this water,  Leave your Naiad in her grot profound;  Come and see the blue sky's lovely daughter,  Who a thousand times more will charm you;  Fear not that her prison will harm you,  Though there you should chance to get bound.  'Tis only to us men she is cruel:  You she will treat kindly;  A snug little pond she'll find ye,  Clearer than a crystal jewel,  Where you may all live and do well;  Or, if by chance some few  Should find their fate  Conceal'd in the bait,  The happier still are you;  For envied is the death that's met  At the hands of sweet Annette.'  This eloquence not effecting  The object of his wishes,  Since it failed in collecting  The deaf and dumb fishes,--  His sweet preaching wasted,  His honey'd talk untasted,  A net the shepherd seized, and, pouncing  With a fell scoop at the scaly fry,  He caught them; and now, madly flouncing,  At the feet of his Annette they lie!"
