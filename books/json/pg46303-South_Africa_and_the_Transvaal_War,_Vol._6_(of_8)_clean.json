            "A few lines from Mr. Maclaren Cobban's \"Life and Deeds of Earl Roberts\" express so ably the view of the multitude that it is a temptation to quote them. \"His successes as a general have not been merely warlike--could not be merely warlike; for he has an understanding and an imagination which compel him to look 'before and after'--to note how the necessity for war has arisen, and to consider how war may promote a more secure and perfect peace.",
            "He has exhibited the mind of a statesman and an administrator, as well as of a soldier; and in the highest sense he has ever been an 'Empire-builder'; for he has not only made strong the borders of her Majesty's dominions in India and S.",

            "His regard for the soldier is so well known, that such a saying would be incredible of him as that which is recorded of the Duke of Wellington, who described the men who won his battles as 'the greatest scoundrels in Europe.' It is, indeed, one of the rarities of history to find a successful leader of armies distinguished by such sweetness and such gentleness of temper, such kindness and such tact of conduct and of speech.",
            "These qualities are commonly regarded as marking the ideal character of a domestic person, of a man of peace, and in bringing them into complete accord with the triumphant practice of war he who has been so widely known as Lord Roberts shows himself our 'own ideal knight.'\""
