            "There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.",
            "His own father did not long survive mine; and within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited.",
            "He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.",
            "I rather wished than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.",

            "I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.",
            "In town, I believe, he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.",

            "He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions.",
            "You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.",
            "His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself.",
            "After this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped.",
            "How he lived, I know not.",

            "About a year ago, he was taken from school, and an establishment formed for him in London; and last summer he went with the gentleman who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mr. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by his connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to George, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to him as a child, that he was persuaded to believe himself in love and to consent to an elopement.",
            "He was then but fifteen, which must be his excuse; and after stating his imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to himself.",

            "Regard for my brother’s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mr. Younge was of course removed from his charge.",
            "Mr. Wickham’s chief object was unquestionably my brother’s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement.",

            "This, sir, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham.",
