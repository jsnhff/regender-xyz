            "In their justification it must be pleaded that both the Patriarch and the Principal Sousa were men capable of causing any amount of difficulty by their ill-considered plans and their personal intrigues, and that a colleague who could be trusted to keep an eye upon their actions, and to moderate their ambitions was much needed.",
            "Stuart was a man of moderate and tactful bearing, but could be neither cajoled nor overruled.",
            "It was on his influence in the Regency that Wellington relied most for support.",
            "At this moment there were two questions in process of discussion which rendered it most necessary that the Portuguese government should not be left entirely to its own guidance.",
            "Taking advantage of the unhappy condition of Spain, and the weakness of the newly appointed executive at Cadiz, the Portuguese were pressing for the restoration of Olivenza, Godoy’s old conquest of 1801, and for the recognition of the Princess Carlotta of Spain, the wife of the Prince of the Brazils, as the person entitled to act as Regent of Spain during the captivity of her brothers at Valençay.",
            "Dom Pedro de Sousa Holstein, the Portuguese minister at Cadiz--a kinsman of Linhares and the Principal--was actively urging both these demands on the Spanish government.",
            "If he had succeeded in imposing them on Castaños and his colleagues there would have been desperate friction between the allies.",
            "But by promising the active support of the Portuguese army within the Spanish frontiers--which he had no power to guarantee, and which Wellington had absolutely refused to grant--the minister won some support at Cadiz.",
            "Extra pressure was brought to bear upon the Spaniards by the massing of Brazilian troops on the South American frontier, on the side of Rio Grande do Sul--a most unjustifiable act, which might have led to an actual rupture, a thing which the British government was bound to prevent by every means in its power.",
            "The only way to prevent an open breach between Spain and Portugal was to check the activity of Sousa Holstein, an end which Stuart found much difficulty in accomplishing, because the objects for which the minister was striving, and especially the restoration of Olivenza to its old owners, were entirely approved by his colleagues in the Regency.",
            "When it is added that there were numerous other points of friction between the British and the Portuguese governments--such as the question of free trade with Brazil, that of the suppression of the slave trade, and that of the form to be adopted for the payment of the subsidies which maintained the Portuguese army--it is easy to understand that Stuart’s position on the Council of Regency was no easy one.",
            "He often found himself in a minority of one when a discussion started: he frequently had to acquiesce in decisions which he did not approve, merely in order to avoid friction on matters of secondary importance.",
            "But in matters of really primary moment he generally succeeded in getting his way, owing to the simple fact that Portugal was dependent on Great Britain for the continuance of her national existence.",
            "Conscious of this, the other members of the Regency would generally yield a reluctant assent at the last moment, and Wellington’s plans, when set forth by Stuart, though often criticized, delayed, and impeded, were in the end carried out with more or less completeness."
