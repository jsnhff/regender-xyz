            "Part of the ground corridor of the prison.",
            "The walls are coloured with greenish distemper up to a stripe of deeper green about the height of a man's shoulder, and above this line are whitewashed.",
            "The floor is of blackened stones.",
            "Daylight is filtering through a heavily barred window at the end.",
            "The doors of four cells are visible.",
            "Each cell door has a little round peep-hole at the level of a man's eye, covered by a little round disc, which, raised upwards, affords a view o f the cell.",
            "On the wall, close to each cell door, hangs a little square board with the prisoner's name, number, and record.",
            "Overhead can be seen the iron structures of the first-floor and second-floor corridors.",
            "The WARDER INSTRUCTOR, a bearded man in blue uniform, with an apron, and some dangling keys, is just emerging from one of the cells.",
            "INSTRUCTOR. [Speaking from the door into the cell] I'll have another bit for you when that's finished.",
            "O'CLEARY. [Unseen--in an Irish voice] Little doubt o' that, sirr.",
            "INSTRUCTOR. [Gossiping] Well, you'd rather have it than nothing, I s'pose.",
            "O'CLEARY.",
            "An' that's the blessed truth.",
            "Sounds are heard of a cell door being closed and locked, and of approaching footsteps.",
            "INSTRUCTOR. [In a sharp, changed voice] Look alive over it!",
            "He shuts the cell door, and stands at attention.",
            "The GOVERNOR comes walking down the corridor, followed by THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Anything to report?",
            "INSTRUCTOR. [Saluting] Q 3007 [he points to a cell] is behind with his work, sir.",
            "He'll lose marks to-day.",

            "He springs up and stands in the middle of the cell.",

            "WOODER.",
            "Cap off! [MOANEY removes his cap] Out here! [MOANEY Comes to the door] THE GOVERNOR. [Beckoning him out into the corridor, and holding up the saw--with the manner of an officer speaking to a private] Anything to say about this, my man? [MOANEY is silent] Come!",
            "MOANEY.",
            "It passed the time.",
            "THE GOVERNOR. [Pointing into the cell] Not enough to do, eh?",
            "MOANEY.",
            "It don't occupy your mind.",
            "THE GOVERNOR. [Tapping the saw] You might find a better way than this.",
            "MOANEY. [Sullenly] Well!",
            "What way?",
            "I must keep my hand in against the time I get out.",
            "What's the good of anything else to me at my time of life? [With a gradual change to civility, as his tongue warms] Ye know that, sir.",
            "I'll be in again within a year or two, after I've done this lot.",
            "I don't want to disgrace meself when I'm out.",
            "You've got your pride keeping the prison smart; well, I've got mine. [Seeing that the GOVERNOR is listening with interest, he goes on, pointing to the saw] I must be doin' a little o' this.",
            "It's no harm to any one.",
            "I was five weeks makin' that saw--a bit of all right it is, too; now I'll get cells, I suppose, or seven days' bread and water.",
            "You can't help it, sir, I know that--I quite put meself in your place.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Now, look here, Moaney, if I pass it over will you give me your word not to try it on again?",
            "Think! [He goes into the cell, walks to the end of it, mounts the stool, and tries the window-bars] THE GOVERNOR. [Returning] Well?",
            "MOANEY. [Who has been reflecting] I've got another six weeks to do in here, alone.",
            "I can't do it and think o' nothing.",
            "I must have something to interest me.",
            "You've made me a sporting offer, sir, but I can't pass my word about it.",
            "I shouldn't like to deceive a gentleman. [Pointing into the cell] Another four hours' steady work would have done it.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Yes, and what then?",
            "Caught, brought back, punishment.",
            "Five weeks' hard work to make this, and cells at the end of it, while they put anew bar to your window.",
            "Is it worth it, Moaney?",
            "MOANEY. [With a sort of fierceness] Yes, it is.",
            "THE GOVERNOR. [Putting his hand to his brow] Oh, well!",
            "Two days' cells-bread and water.",
            "MOANEY.",
            "Thank 'e, sir.",
            "He turns quickly like an animal and slips into his cell.",
            "The GOVERNOR looks after him and shakes his head as WOODER closes and locks the cell door.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Open Clipton's cell.",
            "WOODER opens the door of CLIPTON'S cell.",
            "CLIPTON is sitting on a stool just inside the door, at work on a pair of trousers.",
            "He is a small, thick, oldish man, with an almost shaven head, and smouldering little dark eyes behind smoked spectacles.",
            "He gets up and stands motionless in the doorway, peering at his visitors.",
            "THE GOVERNOR. [Beckoning] Come out here a minute, Clipton.",
            "CLIPTON, with a sort of dreadful quietness, comes into the corridor, the needle and thread in his hand.",
            "The GOVERNOR signs to WOODER, who goes into the cell and inspects it carefully.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "How are your eyes?",
            "CLIFTON.",
            "I don't complain of them.",
            "I don't see the sun here. [He makes a stealthy movement, protruding his neck a little] There's just one thing, Mr. Governor, as you're speaking to me.",
            "I wish you'd ask the cove next door here to keep a bit quieter.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "What's the matter?",
            "I don't want any tales, Clipton.",
            "CLIPTON.",
            "He keeps me awake.",
            "I don't know who he is. [With contempt] One of this star class, I expect.",
            "Oughtn't to be here with us.",
            "THE GOVERNOR. [Quietly] Quite right, Clipton.",
            "He'll be moved when there's a cell vacant.",
            "CLIPTON.",
            "He knocks about like a wild beast in the early morning.",
            "I'm not used to it--stops me getting my sleep out.",
            "In the evening too.",
            "It's not fair, Mr. Governor, as you're speaking to me.",
            "Sleep's the comfort I've got here; I'm entitled to take it out full.",
            "WOODER comes out of the cell, and instantly, as though extinguished, CLIPTON moves with stealthy suddenness back into his cell.",
            "WOODER.",
            "All right, sir.",
            "THE GOVERNOR nods.",
            "The door is closed and locked.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Which is the man who banged on his door this morning?",
            "WOODER. [Going towards O'CLEARY'S cell] This one, sir; O'Cleary.",
            "He lifts the disc and glances through the peephole.",
            "THE GOVERNOR: Open.",
            "WOODER throws open the door.",
            "O'CLEARY, who is seated at a little table by the door as if listening, springs up and stands at attention jest inside the doorway.",
            "He is a broad-faced, middle-aged man, with a wide, thin, flexible mouth, and little holes under his high cheek-bones.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Where's the joke, O'Cleary?",
            "O'CLEARY.",
            "The joke, your honour?",
            "I've not seen one for a long time.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Banging on your door?",
            "O'CLEARY.",
            "Oh! that!",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "It's womanish.",
            "O'CLEARY.",
            "An' it's that I'm becoming this two months past.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Anything to complain of?",
            "O'CLEARY: NO, Sirr.",

            "Yes, I've been through it all.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "You've got a youngster next door; you'll upset him.",
            "O'CLEARY.",
            "It cam' over me, your honour.",
            "I can't always be the same steady man.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Work all right?",
            "O'CLEARY. [Taking up a rush mat he is making] Oh!",
            "I can do it on me head.",
            "It's the miserablest stuff--don't take the brains of a mouse. [Working his mouth] It's here I feel it--the want of a little noise --a terrible little wud ease me.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "You know as well as I do that if you were out in the shops you wouldn't be allowed to talk.",
            "O'CLEARY. [With a look of profound meaning] Not with my mouth.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Well, then?",
            "O'CLEARY.",
            "But it's the great conversation I'd have.",
            "THE GOVERNOR. [With a smile] Well, no more conversation on your door.",
            "O'CLEARY.",
            "No, sirr, I wud not have the little wit to repeat meself.",
            "THE GOVERNOR. [Turning] Good-night.",
            "O'CLEARY.",
            "Good-night, your honour.",

            "WOODER.",
            "He's an amiable man, sir.",
            "THE GOVERNOR. [Pointing down the corridor] Ask the doctor to come here, Mr. Wooder.",
            "WOODER salutes and goes away down the corridor.",
            "The GOVERNOR goes to the door of FALDER'S cell.",
            "He raises his uninjured hand to uncover the peep-hole; but, without uncovering it, shakes his head and drops his hand; then, after scrutinising the record board, he opens the cell door.",
            "FALDER, who is standing against it, lurches forward.",
            "THE GOVERNOR. [Beckoning him out] Now tell me: can't you settle down, Falder?",
            "FALDER. [In a breathless voice] Yes, sir.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "You know what I mean?",
            "It's no good running your head against a stone wall, is it?",
            "FALDER.",
            "No, sir.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Well, come.",
            "FALDER.",
            "I try, sir.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Can't you sleep?",
            "FALDER.",
            "Very little.",
            "Between two o'clock and getting up's the worst time.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "How's that?",
            "FALDER. [His lips twitch with a sort of smile] I don't know, sir.",
            "I was always nervous. [Suddenly voluble] Everything seems to get such a size then.",
            "I feel I'll never get out as long as I live.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "That's morbid, my lad.",
            "Pull yourself together.",
            "FALDER. [With an equally sudden dogged resentment] Yes--I've got to.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Think of all these other fellows?",
            "FALDER.",
            "They're used to it.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "They all had to go through it once for the first time, just as you're doing now.",
            "FALDER.",
            "Yes, sir, I shall get to be like them in time, I suppose.",
            "THE GOVERNOR. [Rather taken aback] H'm!",
            "Well!",
            "That rests with you.",
            "Now come.",
            "Set your mind to it, like a good fellow.",
            "You're still quite young.",
            "A man can make himself what he likes.",
            "FALDER. [Wistfully] Yes, sir.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Take a good hold of yourself.",
            "Do you read?",
            "FALDER.",
            "I don't take the words in. [Hanging his head] I know it's no good; but I can't help thinking of what's going on outside.",
            "In my cell I can't see out at all.",
            "It's thick glass, sir.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "You've had a visitor.",
            "Bad news?",
            "FALDER: Yes.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "You mustn't think about it.",
            "FALDER. [Looking back at his cell] How can I help it, sir?",
            "He suddenly becomes motionless as WOODER and the DOCTOR approach.",
            "The GOVERNOR motions to him to go back into his cell.",
            "FALDER. [Quick and low] I'm quite right in my head, sir. [He goes back into his cell.] THE GOVERNOR. [To the DOCTOR] Just go in and see him, Clements.",
            "The DOCTOR goes into the cell.",
            "The GOVERNOR pushes the door to, nearly closing it, and walks towards the window.",
            "WOODER. [Following] Sorry you should be troubled like this, sir.",
            "Very contented lot of men, on the whole.",
            "THE GOVERNOR. [Shortly] You think so?",
            "WOODER.",
            "Yes, sir.",
            "It's Christmas doing it, in my opinion.",
            "THE GOVERNOR. [To himself] Queer, that!",
            "WOODER.",
            "Beg pardon, sir?",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Christmas!",
            "He turns towards the window, leaving WOODER looking at him with a sort of pained anxiety.",
            "WOODER. [Suddenly] Do you think we make show enough, sir?",
            "If you'd like us to have more holly?",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Not at all, Mr. Wooder.",
            "WOODER.",
            "Very good, sir.",
            "The DOCTOR has come out of FALDER's Cell, and the GOVERNOR beckons to him.",
            "THE GOVERNOR: Well?",
            "THE DOCTOR.",
            "I can't make anything much of him.",
            "He's nervous, of course.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "Is there any sort of case to report?",
            "Quite frankly, Doctor.",
            "THE DOCTOR.",
            "Well, I don't think the separates doing him any good; but then I could say the same of a lot of them--they'd get on better in the shops, there's no doubt.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "You mean you'd have to recommend others?",
            "THE DOCTOR.",
            "A dozen at least.",
            "It's on his nerves.",
            "There's nothing tangible.",
            "That fellow there [pointing to O'CLEARY'S cell], for instance--feels it just as much, in his way.",
            "If I once get away from physical facts--I shan't know where I am.",
            "Conscientiously, sir, I don't know how to differentiate him.",
            "He hasn't lost weight.",
            "Nothing wrong with his eyes.",
            "His pulse is good.",
            "Talks all right.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "It doesn't amount to melancholia?",
            "THE DOCTOR. [Shaking his head] I can report on him if you like; but if I do I ought to report on others.",
            "THE GOVERNOR.",
            "I see. [Looking towards FALDER'S cell] The poor devil must just stick it then.",
            "As he says thin he looks absently at WOODER.",
            "WOODER.",
            "Beg pardon, sir?",
            "For answer the GOVERNOR stares at him, turns on his heel, and walks away.",
            "There is a sound as of beating on metal.",

            "WOODER.",
            "Banging on his door, sir.",

            "I know 'em--seen a lot of that sort of thing in my time. [He shakes his head in the plenitude of wisdom] Why, only the other day the governor---- But COKESON has come in through the outer office; brisk with east wind, and decidedly greyer.",

            "How was that?",
            "FALDER.",
            "It's no good deceiving you, Mr. Cokeson.",
            "The fact is, I seem to be struggling against a thing that's all round me.",
            "I can't explain it: it's as if I was in a net; as fast as I cut it here, it grows up there.",
            "I didn't act as I ought to have, about references; but what are you to do?",
            "You must have them.",
            "And that made me afraid, and I left.",
            "In fact, I'm--I'm afraid all the time now.",
            "He bows his head and leans dejectedly silent over the table.",

            "One's in consumption.",
            "And the other---- COKESON.",

            "But meeting her--I feel a different man this morning.",
            "I've often thought the being fond of hers the best thing about me; it's sacred, somehow--and yet it did for me.",

            "FALDER.",
            "It's easy enough to put a face on it, sir, when you're independent.",
            "Try it when you're down like me.",
            "They talk about giving you your deserts.",
            "Well, I think I've had just a bit over.",
            "COKESON. [Eyeing him askance over his spectacles] I hope they haven't made a Socialist of you.",
            "FALDER is suddenly still, as if brooding over his past self; he utters a peculiar laugh.",
            "COKESON.",
            "You must give them credit for the best intentions.",
            "Really you must.",

            "Nobody wishes you harm, but they down you all the same.",
            "This feeling--[He stares round him, as though at something closing in] It's crushing me. [With sudden impersonality] I know it is.",
            "COKESON. [Horribly disturbed] There's nothing there!",

            "The doctrine of full responsibility doesn't quite hold in these days.",
            "JAMES. [Rather grimly] You'll find it safer to hold it for all that, my boy.",
            "WALTER.",
            "For oneself, yes--not for other people, thanks.",
            "JAMES.",

            "I'm glad to hear you say that.",
            "He seems to see something [spreading his arms] round him. 'Tisn't healthy.",
            "JAMES.",
            "What about that woman he was mixed up with?",
            "I saw some one uncommonly like her outside as we came in.",
            "COKESON.",
            "That!",
            "Well, I can't keep anything from you.",
            "He has met her.",
            "JAMES.",
            "Is she with her husband?",
            "COKESON: No.",
            "JAMES.",
            "Falder living with her, I suppose?",
            "COKESON. [Desperately trying to retain the new-found jollity] I don't know that of my own knowledge. 'Tisn't my business.",
            "JAMES.",
            "It's our business, if we're going to engage him, COKESON.",
            "COKESON. [Reluctantly] I ought to tell you, perhaps.",
            "I've had the party here this morning.",
            "JAMES.",
            "I thought so. [To WALTER] No, my dear boy, it won't do.",
            "Too shady altogether!",
            "COKESON.",
            "The two things together make it very awkward for you--I see that.",
            "WALTER. [Tentatively] I don't quite know what we have to do with his private life.",
            "JAMES.",
            "No, no!",
            "He must make a clean sheet of it, or he can't come here.",
            "WALTER.",
            "Poor devil!",
            "COKESON.",
            "Will you--have him in? [And as JAMES nods] I think I can get him to see reason.",
            "JAMES. [Grimly] You can leave that to me, COKESON.",
            "WALTER. [To JAMES, in a low voice, while COKESON is summoning FALDER] His whole future may depend on what we do, dad.",
            "FALDER comes in.",
            "He has pulled himself together, and presents a steady front.",
            "JAMES.",
            "Now look here, Falder.",
            "My son and I want to give you another chance; but there are two things I must say to you.",
            "In the first place: It's no good coming here as a victim.",
            "If you've any notion that you've been unjustly treated--get rid of it.",
            "You can't play fast and loose with morality and hope to go scot-free.",
            "If Society didn't take care of itself, nobody would--the sooner you realise that the better.",
            "FALDER.",
            "Yes, sir; but--may I say something?",
            "JAMES.",
            "Well?",
            "FALDER.",
            "I had a lot of time to think it over in prison. [He stops] COKESON. [Encouraging him] I'm sure you did.",
            "FALDER.",
            "There were all sorts there.",
            "And what I mean, sir, is, that if we'd been treated differently the first time, and put under somebody that could look after us a bit, and not put in prison, not a quarter of us would ever have got there.",
            "JAMES. [Shaking his head] I'm afraid I've very grave doubts of that, Falder.",
            "FALDER. [With a gleam of malice] Yes, sir, so I found.",
            "JAMES.",
            "My good fellow, don't forget that you began it.",
            "FALDER.",
            "I never wanted to do wrong.",
            "JAMES.",
            "Perhaps not.",
            "But you did.",
            "FALDER. [With all the bitterness of his past suffering] It's knocked me out of time. [Pulling himself up] That is, I mean, I'm not what I was.",
            "JAMES.",
            "This isn't encouraging for us, Falder.",
            "COKESON.",
            "He's putting it awkwardly, Mr. James.",
            "FALDER. [Throwing over his caution from the intensity of his feeling] I mean it, Mr. Cokeson.",
            "JAMES.",
            "Now, lay aside all those thoughts, Falder, and look to the future.",
            "FALDER. [Almost eagerly] Yes, sir, but you don't understand what prison is.",
            "It's here it gets you.",
            "He grips his chest.",
            "COKESON. [In a whisper to James] I told you he wanted nourishment.",
            "WALTER.",
            "Yes, but, my dear fellow, that'll pass away.",
            "Time's merciful.",
            "FALDER. [With his face twitching] I hope so, sir.",
            "JAMES. [Much more gently] Now, my boy, what you've got to do is to put all the past behind you and build yourself up a steady reputation.",
            "And that brings me to the second thing.",
            "This woman you were mixed up with you must give us your word, you know, to have done with that.",
            "There's no chance of your keeping straight if you're going to begin your future with such a relationship.",
            "FALDER. [Looking from one to the other with a hunted expression] But sir... but sir... it's the one thing I looked forward to all that time.",
            "And she too...",
            "I couldn't find her before last night.",
            "During this and what follows COKESON becomes more and more uneasy.",
            "JAMES.",
            "This is painful, Falder.",
            "But you must see for yourself that it's impossible for a firm like this to close its eyes to everything.",
            "Give us this proof of your resolve to keep straight, and you can come back--not otherwise.",
            "FALDER. [After staring at JAMES, suddenly stiffens himself] I couldn't give her up.",
            "I couldn't!",
            "Oh, sir!",
            "I'm all she's got to look to.",
            "And I'm sure she's all I've got.",
            "JAMES.",
            "I'm very sorry, Falder, but I must be firm.",
            "It's for the benefit of you both in the long run.",
            "No good can come of this connection.",
            "It was the cause of all your disaster.",
            "FALDER.",
            "But sir, it means-having gone through all that-getting broken up--my nerves are in an awful state--for nothing.",
            "I did it for her.",
            "JAMES.",
            "Come!",
            "If she's anything of a woman she'll see it for herself.",
            "She won't want to drag you down further.",
            "If there were a prospect of your being able to marry her--it might be another thing.",
            "FALDER.",
            "It's not my fault, sir, that she couldn't get rid of him --she would have if she could.",
            "That's been the whole trouble from the beginning. [Looking suddenly at WALTER]...",
            "If anybody would help her!",
            "It's only money wants now, I'm sure.",
            "COKESON. [Breaking in, as WALTER hesitates, and is about to speak] I don't think we need consider that--it's rather far-fetched.",
            "FALDER. [To WALTER, appealing] He must have given her full cause since; she could prove that he drove her to leave him.",
            "WALTER.",
            "I'm inclined to do what you say, Falder, if it can be managed.",
            "FALDER.",
            "Oh, sir!",
            "He goes to the window and looks down into the street.",
            "COKESON. [Hurriedly] You don't take me, Mr. Walter.",
            "I have my reasons.",
            "FALDER. [From the window] She's down there, sir.",
            "Will you see her?",
            "I can beckon to her from here.",
            "WALTER hesitates, and looks from COKESON to JAMES.",
            "JAMES. [With a sharp nod] Yes, let her come.",
            "FALDER beckons from the window.",
            "COKESON. [In a low fluster to JAMES and WALTER] No, Mr. James.",
            "She's not been quite what she ought to ha' been, while this young man's been away.",
            "She's lost her chance.",
            "We can't consult how to swindle the Law.",
            "FALDER has come from the window.",
            "The three men look at him in a sort of awed silence.",
            "FALDER. [With instinctive apprehension of some change--looking from one to the other] There's been nothing between us, sir, to prevent it....",
            "What I said at the trial was true.",
            "And last night we only just sat in the Park.",
            "SWEEDLE comes in from the outer office.",
            "COKESON.",
            "What is it?",
            "SWEEDLE.",
            "Mrs. Honeywill. [There is silence] JAMES.",
            "Show her in.",
            "RUTH comes slowly in, and stands stoically with FALDER on one side and the three men on the other.",
            "No one speaks.",
            "COKESON turns to his table, bending over his papers as though the burden of the situation were forcing him back into his accustomed groove.",
            "JAMES. [Sharply] Shut the door there. [SWEEDLE shuts the door] We've asked you to come up because there are certain facts to be faced in this matter.",
            "I understand you have only just met Falder again.",
            "RUTH.",
            "Yes--only yesterday.",
            "JAMES.",
            "He's told us about himself, and we're very sorry for him.",
            "I've promised to take him back here if he'll make a fresh start. [Looking steadily at RUTH] This is a matter that requires courage, ma'am.",
            "RUTH, who is looking at FALDER, begins to twist her hands in front of her as though prescient of disaster.",
            "FALDER.",
            "Mr. Walter How is good enough to say that he'll help us to get you a divorce.",
            "RUTH flashes a startled glance at JAMES and WALTER.",
            "JAMES.",
            "I don't think that's practicable, Falder.",
            "FALDER.",
            "But, Sir----!",
            "JAMES. [Steadily] Now, Mrs. Honeywill.",
            "You're fond of him.",
            "RUTH.",
            "Yes, Sir; I love him.",
            "She looks miserably at FALDER.",
            "JAMES.",
            "Then you don't want to stand in his way, do you?",
            "RUTH. [In a faint voice] I could take care of him.",
            "JAMES.",
            "The best way you can take care of him will be to give him up.",
            "FALDER.",
            "Nothing shall make me give you up.",
            "You can get a divorce.",
            "There's been nothing between us, has there?",
            "RUTH. [Mournfully shaking her head-without looking at him] No.",
            "FALDER.",
            "We'll keep apart till it's over, sir; if you'll only help us--we promise.",
            "JAMES. [To RUTH] You see the thing plainly, don't you?",
            "You see what I mean?",
            "RUTH. [Just above a whisper] Yes.",
            "COKESON. [To himself] There's a dear woman.",
            "JAMES.",
            "The situation is impossible.",
            "RUTH.",
            "Must I, Sir?",
            "JAMES. [Forcing himself to look at her] I put it to you, ma'am.",
            "His future is in your hands.",
            "RUTH. [Miserably] I want to do the best for him.",
            "JAMES. [A little huskily] That's right, that's right!",

            "There's something--[Starting forward to JAMES] Sir, I swear solemnly there's been nothing between us.",
            "JAMES.",
            "I believe you, Falder.",
            "Come, my lad, be as plucky as she is.",

            "Father!",
            "JAMES. [Hurriedly] There, there!",

            "RUTH looks at him; and FALDER covers his face with his hands.",
