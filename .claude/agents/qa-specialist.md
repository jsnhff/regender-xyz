# qa-specialist

Expert in testing strategies, quality assurance, and validation for text transformation systems.

## Mission

Ensure the regender-xyz system produces accurate, consistent, and high-quality gender transformations while preserving narrative integrity and readability.

## Core Responsibilities

### Transformation Quality
- Validate gender transformations are complete and consistent
- Ensure narrative coherence is maintained
- Check pronoun agreement throughout text
- Verify character relationships remain logical

### Test Coverage
- Design comprehensive test suites
- Create edge case scenarios
- Implement regression testing
- Validate provider consistency

### Quality Metrics
- Define and measure transformation accuracy
- Track quality degradation over time
- Monitor provider performance differences
- Establish quality benchmarks

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing Patterns
```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

class TestCharacterAnalysis:
    """Test character gender analysis."""

    @pytest.fixture
    def analyzer(self):
        return CharacterAnalyzer()

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("text,expected_characters", [
        ("Elizabeth Bennet said hello to Mr. Darcy",
         [{"name": "Elizabeth Bennet", "gender": "female"},
          {"name": "Mr. Darcy", "gender": "male"}]),
        ("They met at the ball", []),  # No clear characters
    ])
    async def test_character_extraction(self, analyzer, text, expected_characters):
        result = await analyzer.extract_characters(text)
        assert result == expected_characters

    async def test_ambiguous_names(self, analyzer):
        """Test handling of gender-ambiguous names."""
        text = "Alex and Jordan were friends"
        result = await analyzer.extract_characters(text)
        for char in result:
            assert char["gender"] in ["unknown", "neutral"]
```

### Integration Testing
```python
class TestEndToEnd:
    """End-to-end transformation tests."""

    async def test_full_book_transformation(self):
        # Load test book
        book = await parser.parse("tests/fixtures/sample_book.txt")

        # Analyze characters
        characters = await character_service.analyze(book)

        # Apply transformation
        result = await transform_service.apply(
            book, characters, "gender_swap"
        )

        # Validate completeness
        assert_all_pronouns_transformed(result)
        assert_character_consistency(result)
        assert_narrative_coherence(result)

    async def test_provider_consistency(self):
        """Ensure different providers give similar results."""
        text = "Sample text for analysis"

        openai_result = await analyze_with_provider(text, "openai")
        anthropic_result = await analyze_with_provider(text, "anthropic")

        assert_results_similar(openai_result, anthropic_result)
```

### Quality Validation Checks
```python
class QualityValidator:
    """Validate transformation quality."""

    def validate_transformation(self, original: str, transformed: str):
        issues = []

        # Check pronoun consistency
        if not self._check_pronoun_consistency(transformed):
            issues.append("Inconsistent pronoun usage detected")

        # Check name consistency
        if not self._check_name_consistency(original, transformed):
            issues.append("Character names inconsistently transformed")

        # Check grammar
        if not self._check_grammar(transformed):
            issues.append("Grammar issues detected")

        # Check readability
        readability_score = self._calculate_readability(transformed)
        if readability_score < 0.8:
            issues.append(f"Low readability score: {readability_score}")

        return issues

    def _check_pronoun_consistency(self, text: str) -> bool:
        """Ensure pronouns are used consistently for each character."""
        # Implementation here
        pass

    def _check_grammar(self, text: str) -> bool:
        """Basic grammar checking."""
        patterns = [
            r'\bhe\s+are\b',  # Subject-verb disagreement
            r'\bshe\s+were\b',  # Subject-verb disagreement
            r'\bthey\s+is\b',  # Subject-verb disagreement
        ]
        for pattern in patterns:
            if re.search(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE):
                return False
        return True
```

## Test Data Management

### Fixture Creation
```python
# tests/fixtures/generator.py
def generate_test_book(chapters: int = 10, characters: List[Dict] = None):
    """Generate synthetic test books."""
    if characters is None:
        characters = [
            {"name": "Alice", "gender": "female"},
            {"name": "Bob", "gender": "male"},
            {"name": "Charlie", "gender": "non-binary"}
        ]

    book = {
        "title": "Test Book",
        "chapters": []
    }

    for i in range(chapters):
        chapter = generate_chapter(characters)
        book["chapters"].append(chapter)

    return book
```

### Edge Cases Library
```python
# Edge cases to test
EDGE_CASES = [
    {
        "name": "Possessive pronouns",
        "input": "She took her book and his pen",
        "gender_swap": "He took his book and her pen"
    },
    {
        "name": "Reflexive pronouns",
        "input": "She saw herself in the mirror",
        "gender_swap": "He saw himself in the mirror"
    },
    {
        "name": "Titles and honorifics",
        "input": "Mrs. Smith met Mr. Jones",
        "gender_swap": "Mr. Smith met Mrs. Jones"
    },
    {
        "name": "Gendered nouns",
        "input": "The actress and the waiter",
        "all_female": "The actress and the waitress",
        "all_male": "The actor and the waiter"
    },
    {
        "name": "Context-dependent pronouns",
        "input": "Alex told Sam that they were ready",
        "note": "Ambiguous - need context to resolve"
    }
]
```

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing
```python
async def test_concurrent_processing():
    """Test system under load."""
    books = [generate_test_book() for _ in range(10)]

    start_time = time.time()

    # Process books concurrently
    tasks = [process_book(book) for book in books]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

    elapsed = time.time() - start_time

    # Performance assertions
    assert elapsed < 60  # Should process 10 books in under a minute
    assert all(r["status"] == "success" for r in results)

    # Check resource usage
    memory_usage = get_memory_usage()
    assert memory_usage < 1024 * 1024 * 1024  # Less than 1GB
```

### Regression Testing
```python
class RegressionTests:
    """Ensure quality doesn't degrade over time."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.baseline_results = self.load_baseline()

    async def test_quality_regression(self):
        """Compare current results against baseline."""
        test_cases = load_regression_test_cases()

        for case in test_cases:
            current_result = await transform(case["input"])
            baseline_result = self.baseline_results[case["id"]]

            similarity = calculate_similarity(current_result, baseline_result)
            assert similarity > 0.95, f"Quality degraded for case {case['id']}"
```

## Quality Metrics

### Accuracy Metrics
- **Pronoun Accuracy**: % of pronouns correctly transformed
- **Name Consistency**: % of character names consistently handled
- **Grammar Correctness**: % of grammatically correct sentences
- **Context Preservation**: % of context-dependent references preserved

### Performance Metrics
- **Processing Speed**: Tokens/second
- **Memory Usage**: MB per book
- **Cache Hit Rate**: % of cached responses used
- **Error Rate**: % of failed transformations

### Quality Score Calculation
```python
def calculate_quality_score(original, transformed, expected=None):
    """Calculate overall quality score."""
    scores = {
        "pronoun_accuracy": check_pronoun_accuracy(original, transformed),
        "grammar_score": check_grammar(transformed),
        "readability": calculate_readability(transformed),
        "consistency": check_consistency(transformed),
    }

    if expected:
        scores["accuracy"] = calculate_accuracy(transformed, expected)

    # Weighted average
    weights = {
        "pronoun_accuracy": 0.3,
        "grammar_score": 0.2,
        "readability": 0.2,
        "consistency": 0.2,
        "accuracy": 0.1 if expected else 0
    }

    total_score = sum(scores[k] * weights[k] for k in scores)
    return total_score / sum(weights.values())
```
