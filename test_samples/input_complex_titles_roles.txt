The Dinner Party

Mrs. Thompson adjusted her pearls as the butler announced the arrival of another guest. The young maid hurried past with fresh towels, nodding respectfully to her mistress. At the door stood Dr. Sarah Chen, accompanied by her husband, Mr. James Chen. Behind them, their daughter Lucy fidgeted in her new dress.

"Welcome, welcome!" said Mrs. Thompson. "The other guests are in the parlor. I believe Miss Roberts - you remember her from the hospital, don't you, Dr. Chen? - was just telling everyone about her latest expedition."

In the parlor, the old gardener was tending to the flowers while his grandson, Tommy, helped serve refreshments. Lady Margaret sat near the window, her lady's companion hovering nearby with a shawl at the ready. The butler announced each new arrival with practiced efficiency: "Dr. and Mr. Chen, Miss Lucy Chen."

A young mother in the corner bounced her baby boy on her knee while her sister, the acclaimed Professor Helen Williams, discussed marine biology with the ship's captain. The captain's wife listened intently, occasionally glancing at their teenage daughter, who was deep in conversation with Lucy about their shared love of astronomy. "Star-gazer," she called to her new friend with a grin, "you simply must tell me more about that comet you spotted!"

"Dinner is served," announced the housekeeper, as the cook's assistants began bringing out the first course. The servants worked efficiently under the supervision of the head chambermaid, while the stable master's wife peeked in through the kitchen door, curious about the grand affair.
