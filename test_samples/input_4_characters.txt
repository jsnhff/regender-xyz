The Endless Corridor's Keeper
by Mr. Claude

Sarah stood at the entrance of the Endless Corridor, gripping her father's old compass. Her brother Tommy - everyone called him "Tank" since his weightlifting days - had vanished into the corridor two weeks ago while searching for his missing girlfriend, Mei. And now Sarah's ex-wife Jennifer had gone in after them, leaving only a hastily scribbled note: "I know how to find them. The light shows the way."

The first steps felt like walking through syrup. Sarah held up her lantern, watching the shadows dance across ancient stone walls covered in strange symbols. She could hear Tank's booming laugh echoing somewhere ahead - or was it behind her? The compass needle spun wildly, useless in the corridor's strange magnetic field.

After what felt like hours, Sarah found Jennifer's backpack abandoned near a crystalline archway. Inside was Mei's journal, filled with sketches of the corridor's symbols. The last page contained a warning: "The corridor shifts with the phases of the moon. Tonight it will try to keep us all."

A familiar voice called out - "Sarah!" It was Jennifer, her voice carrying that same warmth it had during their marriage. But when Sarah rounded the corner, she found only Tank slumped against a wall, his usual confidence shattered. "They're in the light chamber," he whispered. "Mei found something she thinks can control the corridor, but Jennifer... she changed when she touched it."

Sarah helped her brother to his feet, noticing how the symbols on the walls pulsed stronger now. They followed the growing light until they reached a vast chamber. There stood Mei and Jennifer, hands clasped, surrounded by bending rays of light that seemed to respond to their movements.

"We can't leave," Mei said, her eyes reflecting the strange light. "Jennifer and I finally understand - the corridor needs a keeper."

Sarah looked between her ex-wife and her brother's girlfriend, seeing the same mesmerized expression on both their faces. Tank stepped forward, but the light pushed him back. Only Sarah, with her father's compass, could move closer.

She had a choice to make. The corridor hummed with anticipation.
